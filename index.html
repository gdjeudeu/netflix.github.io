						</p>
						<p>
							Netflix was founded in 1997 in Scotts Valley, California. It was originally a rent-by-mail DVD service that used a pay-per-rental model.
							Users would browse and order the films they wanted on their website, put in an order, and Netflix would post them to your door. 
							After renters had finished with the DVDs, they would simply post them back.
							With this model, users could keep the DVDs for as long as they liked, but could only rent a new movie after returning their existing one.

							"In 2000, Netflix CEO and co-founder Reed Hastings approached Blockbuster about a partnership. Unfortunately for Blockbuster, their CEO just smiled and laughed at him.

                            In fact, Blockbuster even had a chance to purchase Netflix for $50 million. Netflix currently has a Market Cap of [$209.74B] (July 2020) and a share price of  $476.89, while Blockbuster is out of business." - rewindandcapture.com.
